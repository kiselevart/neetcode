code and notes of my personal work on the neetcode roadmap
methodology:
  i follow the roadmap set out in https://neetcode.io/roadmap
  aiming to solve at minimum one problem a day whenever possible
  spend around 30 minutes on the problem on my own, after that I look at the attached video for help
  using obsidian to take notes and think about the problem
