this is a folder of my personal work and notes on the neetcode roadmap for leetcode.
methodology:
* i follow the roadmap that is set out in [https://neetcode.io/roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap).
* aiming to solve at least one problem a day
* spend around 30-60 minutes on each problem on my own, after that i check the posted solution whether i solved the problem or not, to learn from it
* using obsidian to take notes and think about the problem
